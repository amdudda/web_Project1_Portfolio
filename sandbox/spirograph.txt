Spirograph equation:

R = radius of outer circle
r = radius of inner circle
p = rho; distance of pen from origin of r inside inner circle
t = angle between y axis and line from orgin to r.

	let l = p/r
	let k = r/R
therefore
	p/R = lk

(x,y) for angle t is:

x(t) = R * ( ((1-k)*cos(t)) + l*k*cos( ( (1-k) / k) * t ) )
y(t) = R * ( ((1-k)*sin(t)) + l*k*sin( ( (1-k) / k) * t ) )
