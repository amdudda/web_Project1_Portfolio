# web_Project1_Portfolio
An online portfolio for my GitHub projects.

## Description
* This pulls JSON data from GitHub, stores the data, and displays it.  
* It uses Bootstrap for layout, with some CSS customization.
* There are buttons to filter projects by coding language, as well as the ability to sort the data in several ways.
* Clicking on view readme shows a div container that pulls down the contents of a repository's README.md if it exists.

## Known Issues
* Unable to get my header containers to flow exactly the way I want them to, but what's in place works OK for now.
* I would like to show a readme link only if files actually have a readme, but I suspect checking each one individually will make the page load a bit too slowly.
